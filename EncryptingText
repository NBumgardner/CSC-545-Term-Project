/*
I first considered having the first pixel to hold message length. However, if it's a big message, that wont work.
Instead, we can pass the message length to the decryption part maybe?... Then based on picture 
size, every nth pixel will have a 
change to the b value based on ascii 
value of text to input. will use lower 5 bits for 
storing message.

This array holds all letter options for message. Each index corresponds to the bit
number which will modify the blue value.
